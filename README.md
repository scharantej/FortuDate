## Flask Application Design for a Fortunetelling Dating App

### Objective
Create a Flask application that integrates the concept of fortunetelling into a dating platform.

### HTML Files
**index.html:**
- The main page where users can sign up or log in.
- Contains form fields for username, password, and personal information used for fortunetelling (e.g., birth date).

**dashboard.html:**
- Display matches and provide fortunetelling insights about potential partners.
- Includes sections for viewing daily horoscopes, love compatibility, and personality traits based on birth data.

### Routes
**@app.route('/')**
- Main route that renders the index.html page for sign-up and login.

**@app.route('/dashboard')**
- Route for the dashboard page. Authenticates users and displays matches with their fortunetelling insights.

**@app.route('/horoscope')**
- Route for daily horoscope based on birth date.

**@app.route('/compatibility')**
- Route for love compatibility calculations between users.

**@app.route('/traits')**
- Route for displaying personality traits based on birth data.

**@app.route('/matches')**
- Route for fetching and displaying potential matches for the user.

### Database
- The application utilizes a database to store user information, including birth dates and other data used for fortunetelling.
- The database also stores matches between users based on compatibility calculations and user preferences.

### Other Considerations
- **Fortunetelling Calculations:** The application relies on an external API or a custom algorithm for fortunetelling calculations (e.g., zodiac signs, numerology).
- **User Authentication:** The application uses Flask-Login or a similar module for user authentication and session management.
- **Error Handling:** The application incorporates error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
